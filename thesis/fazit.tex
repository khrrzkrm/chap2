\section{Summary of Contributions}
This dissertation addresses fundamental challenges in the application of formal methods to the digitalization and automated analysis of normative systems.
As laws, regulations, and contracts increasingly govern the behavior of autonomous software agents, the ambiguity of natural language becomes a liability.
To mitigate this risk, we demonstrated that rigorous Normative System Engineering can be achieved by restricting logical expressivity to practitioner-oriented fragments.
This principled restriction allows for the automation of complex reasoning tasks, specifically: precise conflict detection and rich blame assignment. Without assuming our specific assumption, these reasoning tasks are computationally intractable in more general settings.

The first major contribution, presented in Chapter 3, focused on the static analysis of normative specifications.
We introduced the Micro Metric-Time Normative Logic (\TDDLfm) to formalize the detection of conflicts between time-constrained obligations and prohibitions.
By mapping normative requirements to canonical interval sets, we established a precise distinction between deontic conflicts (logical contradictions) and ontic conflicts (physical impossibilities).
We further defined a quantitative measure of conflict density and provided an algorithmic procedure for conflict elimination.
These tools allow regulators to verify and repair specifications before they are deployed, ensuring that \emph{unmabigous} and easy to plan for.

The second major contribution, detailed in Chapter 4, shifted the focus to the dynamic monitoring of collaborative interactions.
We developed the Two-Agents Collaborative Normative Logic (\cDL) to model contracts where compliance depends on the joint actions of multiple parties.
A key innovation of this framework is the formal separation of ``attempts'' from ``outcomes,'' which allows the system to distinguish between genuine non-compliance and failure caused by the other contract party interference.
Building on this model, we defined both a forward-looking tight semantics for immediate verdict generation and a quantitative semantics for cumulative blame assessment.
The synthesis of these semantics into deterministic monitors provides a verified pipeline for runtime enforcement.

Taken together, these chapters provide a unified methodology for the lifecycle of digital norms.
From the static verification of the rule set to the dynamic attribution of blame during execution, the formalisms developed here ensure that automated compliance remains transparent, fair, and logically consistent.

\section{Future Work}

The results presented in this dissertation open several avenues for future research, ranging from theoretical extensions to practical applications in formal computational law.



\subsection{Toward a Unified Formalism (\logic{MTTACNL})}

The natural progression of this research lies in the synthesis of the two primary formalisms developed in this dissertation.
While Chapter 3 established \TDDLfm for rigorous temporal conflict analysis and Chapter 4 introduced \cDL for blame attribution, their current isolation limits their applicability to scenarios exhibiting both strict timing constraints and cooperative dependencies.
To bridge this gap, a primary objective for future work is the development of a unified framework, tentatively styled as the \emph{Metric-Timed Two-Agents Collaborative Normative Logic} (\logic{MTTACNL}).

This unification requires a fundamental reconstruction of the underlying semantic models.
Specifically, the discrete event traces used in our collaborative logic must be replaced by \emph{metric-timed traces} in which every collaborative action and every attempt is associated with a precise real-valued timestamp.
On the syntactic level, the logic must support the seamless integration of interval-based constraints with collaborative operators.
Such a rich syntax would enable the specification of complex requirements, such as an obligation for ``Agent 1 must acomplish action $\acta$ within 5 time units with the help/without the interference of agent 2.''

Operationalizing this unified logic will demand a dual-pronged approach to automated reasoning.
First, regarding static analysis, the conflict detection algorithms presented in Chapter 3 must be adapted to account for multi-agent interference.
This adaptation would allow regulators to verify not only that time windows are satisfiable but also that no agent is implicitly required to block another to fulfill their own duties.
Second, regarding dynamic enforcement, the monitoring infrastructure must be lifted from standard Moore machines to timed automata or similar real-time computational models.
Achieving this would provide a comprehensive solution that simultaneously monitors deadline adherence and attributes blame for non-compliance, thereby fully realizing the vision of robust, time-sensitive digital contracts.

\subsection{Beyond Discrete Actions}

Throughout this dissertation, we have operated under the abstraction that actions are atomic, instantaneous events.
While discrete actions do occur in practice and many real-world norms can be encoded under this abstraction, numerous normative specifications impose obligations whose satisfaction requires sustained execution over an extended period rather than an instantaneous event.
A natural extension of our model is the incorporation of actions with duration, where compliance depends not merely on the occurrence of an event but on the sustained maintenance of a behavior over a prescribed time interval, as suggested by reviewers of the conference version of this work.
Pushing this complexity further leads to the domain of \emph{continuous real-time actions}, a challenging counterpart to discrete logic where the system must monitor varying physical signals such as velocity or temperature rather than symbolic transitions.
Mastering this continuous domain requires developing elegant abstractions that bridge the gap between normative reasoning and control theory, a synthesis necessary to handle the infinite state space of physical time.

Moving beyond the temporal nature of actions brings us to the fundamental distinction between operational steps and declarative goals.
Our current formalism is strictly an \emph{ought-to-do} logic, focusing exclusively on the agents' transitions and interactions.
However, many real-world regulations are naturally expressed as \emph{ought-to-be} specifications that constrain the resulting system state rather than the specific method of achievement.
For example, a safety regulation may mandate that a room remains below a certain temperature without dictating the specific actions of the cooling system.
Capturing the full spectrum of real-life normative specifications therefore requires a hybrid logic capable of reasoning about both the actions performed by agents and the environmental states those actions induce.
